How to deploy locally

Update version number in setup.py:
    version=<major>.<minor>.<maintenance>.<build>

First cd into project folder
> rm -rf build/ dist/
> pip3 uninstall picdb  # if version did not change
> pip3 install .




py2app

* Probably a virtual environment with complete Python installation is required.

$ py2applet --make-setup start_picdb.py
$ rm -rf build dist

# To build the application in alias mode during development,
# execute setup.py with the py2app command
# and specify the -A option (or --alias):
$ python3 setup.py py2app -A

# run from terminal
$ ./dist/MyApplication.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApplication

# or start with launch service
$ open -a dist/start_picdb.app


# build for deployment
$ python3 setup_py2app.py py2app
